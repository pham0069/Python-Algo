- problem: find the optimum value among all the states
- brute-force algorithm: try all states -> could be exhausting
- hill climbing algo: tends to converge to local optimum
- simulated annealing: move from 1 state to another (could be random strategy)
and check if the value gets better
- if only allow good move all the time, we can only find local maximum
- allow bad move in order to find global maximum
- but we should allow bad move with lower probability over time
- to simulate this acceptance probability, we use annealing concept in engineer
T: temperature
if T is high then we can accept bad moves
if T is low then we keep accepting good moves exclusively as with hill climbing
- T typically starts off high and slowly lowered in every iteration
- at each iteration, a new candidate state is generated (randomly for example)
its distance from current point is proportional to the temperature
- if the new point is better, it replaces the current point as the actual best so far
- it is possible to accept and move forward with a a worse state
- the probability of doing so is dependent on T
- Metropolis function:
e ^ ((actual_energy - neighbor energy)/temperature) < random (0, 1)
