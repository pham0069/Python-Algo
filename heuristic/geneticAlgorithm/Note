1. Overview
- motivation behind genetic algorithm is same as simulated annealing
to avoid local optimums and find global optimum
- inspired by the process of natural selection - relying on biologically inspired operators
such as mutation, crossover and selection
- genetic algo: search heuristic that mimic the process of natural selection
- natural selection: process through which species adapt to their environments
it's the engine that drive evolution
- it generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution
such as mutation and crossover
- a candidate solution is evolved toward better and better solutions
- each candidate solution has a set of properties (genes) which can be mutated and altered
- usually the solution is represented in binary
- the evolution starts from a population of randomly generated individuals
- it's an iterative process
the population in each iteration is called a generation
- in each generation the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated with fitness function
- the fitness is usually the value of the cost function in the optimization problem being solved
- the more fit individuals are selected from the current population and each individual's genome is modified
- recombined and possibly randomly mutated to form a new generation
- the new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration
- the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced
or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population
